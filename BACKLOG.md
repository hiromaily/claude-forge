# Claude-Forge Plugin — Backlog

Known issues, improvement candidates, and future direction.

---

## Priority Queue

Ordered by priority. Higher rows should be tackled first.

| # | ID | Issue | Title | Type | Effort | Why now |
|---|-----|-------|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **B1** | — | Dynamic checkpoint UX: user visibility + resume | Bug/Feature | M | **Blocking bug.** Dynamic checkpoints (`design-approved`, `design-retry-limit`, `tasks-approved`, `task-retry-limit`, `design-review-unknown`, `task-review-unknown`, `impl-retry-limit-*`) are not properly handled when AutoApprove=false. Users see sudden abandons with no context about what phase/event caused it. Resume cannot recover from dynamic checkpoint states. |
| 2 | **F10** | [#12](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/12) | Partial execution (`--until`/`--from`) | Feature | M | `--until=design` for scoping only, `--from=phase-5` for re-implementation. Combines with `--auto` for autonomous scoping reports. |
| 3 | **F9** | [#13](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/13) | Structured acceptance criteria | Feature | M | Improves PASS/FAIL consistency. Currently depends on impl-reviewer's subjective interpretation. |
| 4 | **F12** | [#14](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/14) | Checkpoint diff preview | Feature | S | Nice-to-have. `--auto` reduces checkpoint frequency, lowering the priority. |
| 5 | **F18** | [#17](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/17) | Improvement report → test case generation | Feature | S | Auto-generate hook guard test cases from friction points found in improvement reports. Builds on the existing `history_get_friction_map` data. |
| 6 | **F19** | [#18](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/18) | CI feedback loop (post-PR auto-fix) | Feature | L | After PR creation, monitor CI results and auto-trigger fix flow on failure. Closes the quality loop beyond the pipeline boundary. |
| 7 | **F6** | [#19](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/19) | Adaptive model routing | Feature | L | Needs phase-stats data before deciding. Could now be informed by the accumulated `analytics_*` metrics. |
| 8 | **F2** | [#20](https://github.com/hiromaily/claude-forge/issues/20) | Execution log (JSONL) | Feature | M | Basic coverage via phase-log. Full JSONL log deferred until the need is confirmed. |
| 9 | **F20** | — | Shared events log rotation / pruning | Maintenance | S | `~/.claude/forge-events.jsonl` is append-only and grows indefinitely. `SetEventLog` loads the entire file into memory on startup. After weeks of use across many projects the file and in-memory `history` slice will become large. Add max-age trimming (e.g. keep last 30 days) or a file-size cap with rollover to `forge-events.jsonl.old`. |

**Effort key:** XS = < 30min, S = 1-2h, M = half day, L = 1+ day

**Prioritization criteria:**

1. **Blocking bug** — fix first
2. **Determinism** — hook guards to cover AI non-determinism
3. **Dev loop acceleration** — high ROI (F10)
4. **Data flywheel extensions** — leverage the accumulated `history_*` and `profile_*` data (F18)
5. **Cost reduction** — validate with phase-stats data (F6)
6. **Future features** — after data accumulation (F12, F19)

## B1: Dynamic Checkpoint UX — User Visibility + Resume

### Problem

When `AutoApprove=false`, dynamic checkpoints returned by the engine (`design-approved`, `design-retry-limit`, etc.) are not properly handled. The pipeline silently fails or abandons, leaving users with no context about what happened or which phase caused the issue. Resume cannot recover from these states.

**Three concrete failure modes:**
1. **No user visibility** — When a dynamic checkpoint is returned, the orchestrator (LLM) has no clear instructions for how to handle it. The result is a sudden abandon with no explanation of what phase or event triggered it.
2. **Resume broken** — Dynamic checkpoint names (`design-approved`, etc.) are not formal phase IDs (`checkpoint-a`, etc.), so `resume_info` cannot correctly restore pipeline state.
3. **P8 scope gap** — The 2026-04-17 fix added P8 to handle checkpoint responses deterministically, but `isCheckpointPhase()` only recognizes `checkpoint-a` and `checkpoint-b`. All other checkpoint types fall through unhandled.

**Affected dynamic checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint name | Source | Options | Trigger condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `design-approved` | `handlePhaseThreeB` | proceed, revise | AutoApprove=false, verdict=APPROVE |
| `design-retry-limit` | `handlePhaseThreeB` | approve, abandon | DesignRevisions >= MaxRetries |
| `design-review-unknown` | `handlePhaseThreeB` | approve, revise, abandon | Unrecognized verdict |
| `tasks-approved` | `handlePhaseFourB` | proceed, revise | AutoApprove=false, verdict=APPROVE |
| `task-retry-limit` | `handlePhaseFourB` | approve, abandon | TaskRevisions >= MaxRetries |
| `task-workflow-rules-retry-limit` | `handlePhaseFour` | approve, abandon | TaskRevisions >= MaxRetries (workflow rules) |
| `task-review-unknown` | `handlePhaseFourB` | approve, revise, abandon | Unrecognized verdict |
| `impl-retry-limit-{N}` | `handlePhaseFive` | approve, abandon | ImplRetries >= MaxRetries |
| `post-to-source` | `handlePostToSource` | post, skip | Source URL present |

### Design direction

**Option A: Absorb dynamic checkpoints into P8**
- Extend `isCheckpointPhase` to recognize all dynamic checkpoint names.
- Handle each `user_response` (proceed/approve/revise/abandon/post/skip) inside the engine.
- Pro: SKILL.md stays simple (always pass `user_response`).
- Con: P8 logic grows complex; each dynamic checkpoint has different rewind targets and semantics.

**Option B: Eliminate dynamic checkpoints; use formal phase transitions**
- Remove the `design-approved` checkpoint from `handlePhaseThreeB`; let `reportResultCore` call `PhaseComplete` on verdict=APPROVE, reaching `checkpoint-a` directly.
- Retry-limit and unknown-verdict cases become state flags with dedicated phase handling.
- Pro: Clean architecture; no P8 changes needed.
- Con: Retry-limit cases ("human judgment required") need a new mechanism since they cannot map to existing phases.

**Option C: Promote dynamic checkpoints to formal phase IDs**
- Add `design-approved`, `task-retry-limit`, etc. to `ValidPhases`.
- Resume recognizes them as proper phases.
- Pro: Resume works naturally.
- Con: Phase count explodes (18 → 25+); test and documentation impact is large.

### Context

- 2026-04-17: `checkpoint-a` / `checkpoint-b` revise flow fixed (P8 block added to `pipeline_next_action.go`).
- `AutoApprove=true` bypasses dynamic checkpoints entirely, so the problem only manifests with `AutoApprove=false`.
- `AutoApprove=false` is the default when running `/forge` with the `full` template without the `--auto` flag.

## Phase Registry: Deferred Scatter Points

The **declarative phase registry** refactor (`feature/declarative-phase-registry`) consolidated the six per-phase edit sites in `orchestrator/` into two (`state/state.go` + `orchestrator/registry.go`). Two additional per-phase tables were intentionally left out of scope to avoid cross-package coupling:

| Location | Symbol | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp-server/internal/handler/validation/artifact.go` | `artifactRules` | Per-phase lookup table of expected artifact filenames and required headings. Moving into `PhaseDescriptor` would force `engine/orchestrator` to import `handler/validation` (or vice versa), inverting the current clean dependency direction. |
| `mcp-server/internal/engine/state/manager.go` | `PhaseArtifacts` | Per-phase map of artifact filenames used by both `tools.Guard3aArtifactExists` and `state.PhaseCompleteArtifactCheck`. Lives in `engine/state` because both callers already depend on `engine/state`; lifting into a registry would create a circular import between `engine/orchestrator` and `engine/state`. |
| `mcp-server/internal/handler/tools/guards.go` | `phaseLogRequired` | Per-phase guard map consulted by MCP tool handlers. Encoding this in the descriptor would require `engine/orchestrator` to depend on `handler/tools`, which itself imports `engine/orchestrator` — creating a cycle. |

**Future direction:** If a registry package (`orchestrator/registry`) is ever extracted as a leaf package (no imports of `handler/validation`, `engine/state`, or `handler/tools`), all three tables could be merged into extended `PhaseDescriptor` fields. Until then, keep the tables in their respective packages and rely on `TestPhaseRegistryConsistency` + `TestPhaseRegistryLength` + the `initRegistry()` panic to detect ID-set drift.

## Codex Integration (upstream-blocked)

Publishing claude-forge as an OpenAI Codex plugin is blocked by upstream gaps in the Codex 0.121.0 plugin surface. Full analysis in [`docs/research/codex-integration.md`](./docs/research/codex-integration.md).

Unblock conditions:

1. Resolution of [openai/codex#15250](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/15250) — `spawn_agent` accepts named custom agents.
2. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` schema adds `agents` and `hooks` fields.
3. `CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT` (or equivalent) env var is documented for hook scripts.
4. `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` coverage extends to `apply_patch` (Write / Edit equivalent).

Revisit the research doc whenever any upstream item changes.

## Devin-Class Autonomy: Gap Analysis

A reference comparison against Cognition's Devin (autonomous AI software engineer) to clarify what claude-forge would need to become a "set it and forget it" agent rather than a Claude Code-attached pipeline. The gaps split cleanly into three layers — Layer A (execution substrate) is a separate product, Layer B/C are extensions of the existing Go MCP server.

### Concept mapping

Status legend: ✅ shipped · ⏳ in-flight · ⬜ todo · 🚫 out-of-scope (separate product or upstream-blocked).

| Devin capability | Status | claude-forge today | Concrete asset that exists | Concrete missing piece |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cloud sandbox VM with shell + browser + editor | 🚫 | Runs in the user's Claude Code session on the developer's laptop | `forge-state` MCP is a stdio binary (`mcp-server/cmd/main.go`) that can run in any host with a TTY | A long-running orchestrator host (container / serverless job runtime) that owns the workspace, secrets, and CLI process between user prompts |
| Async trigger (Slack mention, Linear assignment, PR comment) | 🚫 | Synchronous `/forge <text>` only | `pipeline_init` accepts `github_issue` / `jira_issue` URLs (`mcp-server/internal/handler/tools/pipeline_init.go`); `events.SlackNotifier` posts outbound notifications (`mcp-server/pkg/events/slack.go`) | An inbound webhook receiver that turns a Slack/Linear/GitHub event into `pipeline_init_with_context` and dispatches to a runner pool |
| Real-time observability dashboard | ✅ | Embedded `/` HTML served by the dashboard package; subscribes to `/events` | `mcp-server/internal/dashboard/{server,handler,dashboard.html}.{go,html}`; opt-in via `FORGE_EVENTS_PORT`; URL is logged on startup | (none — first-cut shipped) |
| Mid-task intervention channel | ✅ | `POST /api/checkpoint/approve` and `POST /api/pipeline/abandon` driven by Approve / Abandon buttons in the dashboard | `mcp-server/internal/dashboard/intervention.go` (loopback + Origin-allowlist guard, structural URL parse), wired to `StateManager.PhaseComplete` / `Abandon` | Branch / fork action; richer "stop without abandon" semantics (currently abandon-only) |
| Multi-task parallelism (one agent, many tickets) | 🚫 | One Claude Code session = one pipeline; only Phase 5 implementers parallelize within a pipeline | Workspace is filesystem-isolated under `.specs/<spec-name>/`; state.json is per-workspace | A scheduler that pins each pipeline to a sandbox and load-balances across runners; required only after Layer A |
| Long-term knowledge ("Devin Knowledge") | ⬜ | `history_*` MCP tools surface past pipeline patterns and friction (`mcp-server/internal/intelligence/history/`) | `KnowledgeBase` indexes `.specs/` (`history/knowledge_base.go:18`), `prompt.BuildPrompt` already injects Layer 4 context with an 8 KT budget guard (`prompt/builder.go:11,29`) | Org-level knowledge: hand-written guidance, API contracts, code-review preferences that persist across repos and feed agent prompts |
| Repository awareness | ⬜ | `profile_get` analyses languages, CI, linters once per repo and caches (`mcp-server/internal/intelligence/profile/analyzer.go`) | Already injected as Layer 3 of the prompt | Per-developer / per-team overrides; profile invalidation strategy when `package.json` / `go.mod` changes |
| CI feedback loop | ⬜ | Pipeline ends at `pr-creation`; no monitoring of GitHub Actions afterwards | `gh pr create` is the last step in `SKILL.md`; `executeFinalCommit` does the push (`tools/git_ops.go:177`) | A post-PR monitor: poll `gh run watch` (or webhook), feed failures back into a new Phase 5 revision; this is BACKLOG **F19** with concrete shape |
| Budget guardrails | ⬜ | `effort` (S/M/L) chooses a flow template; `tokenBudget = 8_000` is only for prompt assembly (`prompt/builder.go:11`) | `analytics_estimate` returns P50/P90 token / cost predictions per `(task_type, effort)` (`analytics/estimator.go`) | Runtime enforcement: compare cumulative `phase-log` totals against an estimate; auto-checkpoint or auto-abandon at threshold. The estimator output is unused by `pipeline_next_action` today |
| Session forking / replay | ⬜ | `revision-bump` retries a single phase, `inline-revision-bump` retries within a phase | State migration helpers (`state/migration.go`) are in place | A `pipeline_fork(workspace, from_phase)` MCP tool that snapshots state.json + workspace dir into a sibling spec, enabling "what if we tried approach B from Phase 3" |
| Secrets management | 🚫 | Inherits the developer's shell environment and `~/.config` files | None | A vault adapter (e.g. 1Password Connect, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Encrypted Secrets) that materializes credentials into the sandbox per pipeline |
| Team handoff | ⏳ | `.specs/<spec-name>/` is committed to git, available to anyone with repo access; the dashboard SSE stream is reachable by any teammate on the same loopback | `post-to-source` checkpoint posts `summary.md` to GitHub / Jira; loopback-only intervention API blocks remote teammates today | Same-LAN "watching" mode: optionally bind the dashboard to a non-loopback interface, with auth, so a teammate can attach without owning the runner |
| Slack inbound | 🚫 | None | `SlackNotifier` is outbound-only; filters to `phase-complete` / `phase-fail` / `abandon` (`events/slack.go:40`) | A Slack Events API receiver that interprets `@forge run "<task>"` and threads progress back to the originating channel |
| Linear / Notion sources | ⬜ | GitHub Issues + Jira only | `pipeline_init` source-type detection lives in `pipeline_init.go` | New source-type branches; **Linear is BACKLOG #31**, Notion is unscoped |
| CLI portability | ⬜ | Claude Code only | MCP protocol is host-agnostic; the binary already runs against any MCP host | Codex, Cursor, JetBrains support — Codex is **upstream-blocked** (see Codex Integration section above) |

### Layered roadmap

The thirteen capabilities above are not all of equal scope. They cluster into three layers; the layer dictates whether the work belongs in this repo at all.

**Layer A — Execution substrate (a new product, not an extension of this plugin).** 🚫 out of scope for this BACKLOG.
Maps to: cloud sandbox, async triggers, multi-task parallelism, secrets management, team handoff (server side).
Why separate: Devin's primary value is "the agent runs while you sleep." That requires owning a process lifecycle, a filesystem, and a credentials store independent of any developer's CLI session. Building this *inside* claude-forge (a Claude Code plugin) creates an architectural conflict — the plugin model assumes a foreground host. A new repository (`claude-forge-runner` / `forge-cloud`) should consume `forge-state` as a library and expose an HTTP control plane, webhook receivers, a sandbox driver (Docker / Firecracker / GCP Cloud Run), and a secrets adapter.
Estimated scope: project-sized (multi-month), out of scope for this BACKLOG.

**Layer B — Observability and intervention (extensions to existing assets).** ⏳ partially shipped.
Maps to: dashboard, intervention channel, browser automation, session forking / replay, team handoff (client side).
Why fits here: every prerequisite exists. `EventBus` + `SSEHandler` already publish a typed event stream; `pipeline_next_action` already returns checkpoint payloads; state.json is already the authoritative store.
Done so far (lives entirely under `mcp-server/internal/dashboard/`):
- ✅ Dashboard MVP (single embedded HTML, opt-in via `FORGE_EVENTS_PORT`, click-through URL printed at startup).
- ✅ Intervention API + UI: `POST /api/checkpoint/approve`, `POST /api/pipeline/abandon`, plus inline Approve and header Abandon buttons. Loopback-only with structural Origin allowlist.
Remaining:
- ⬜ **`pipeline_fork(workspace, from_phase)` MCP tool** — snapshot state.json + workspace dir into a sibling spec to enable "what if we tried approach B from Phase 3".
- ⬜ **Stop-without-abandon intervention** — pause a running pipeline at the next safe boundary instead of marking it abandoned (today's only termination option).
- 🔒 **LAN-watch mode** — on hold. opt-in bind to a non-loopback interface with auth so a teammate can subscribe to the SSE stream without owning the runner. Revisit when multi-user demand is confirmed.

**Layer D — Autonomous task queue (batch execution).** ⬜ new (2026-04-17).
Maps to: sequential multi-task execution, Devin-style autonomous PR creation from a backlog of tickets.
Why a separate layer: Layers A–C extend the *single-pipeline* model. Layer D wraps the existing forge pipeline in an outer loop, processing a user-curated list of tasks without modifying forge internals.

Concept:
- User creates `.specs/queue.yaml` containing a list of issue URLs (Jira, GitHub, Linear, etc.) with effort levels.
- A new skill (`forge-queue`) parses the YAML, picks the first unprocessed task, and invokes the existing `forge` skill with `--auto` + the URL + effort.
- On completion: writes `status: completed` + PR number back to `queue.yaml`, moves to next task.
- On failure: writes `status: failed` + reason, abandons the pipeline, moves to next task.
- Terminates when all tasks are processed.

```yaml
# .specs/queue.yaml
tasks:
  - url: https://jira.example.com/browse/DEA-123
    effort: M
    status: completed
    pr: 2891
    workspace: 2026-04-17-dea-123-fix-login-validation
  - url: https://jira.example.com/browse/DEA-456
    effort: S
    status: failed
    reason: "phase-3: architect could not produce viable design"
    workspace: 2026-04-17-dea-456-add-export-feature
  - url: https://github.com/legalforce/dealon-app/issues/42
    effort: S
  - url: https://jira.example.com/browse/DEA-789
    effort: L
```

Design constraints:
- **Sequential only** — parallel execution is handled by the user opening multiple terminals.
- **`--auto` forced** — no checkpoints; each task runs to completion or failure autonomously.
- **Link-based input only** — tasks are specified as issue URLs; free-text tasks are not supported in queue mode.
- **No forge internals changes** — `forge-queue` is purely an outer loop that calls forge as-is.
- **State lives in `queue.yaml`** — no separate state file; the YAML is both input and status tracker.

Implementation:
- Two new skills: `skills/forge-queue/SKILL.md` (executor), `skills/forge-queue-create/SKILL.md` (generator).
- Five new MCP tools: `queue_create`, `queue_init`, `queue_next`, `queue_report`, `queue_update_pr` (YAML I/O + state.json read).
- New Go package: `mcp-server/internal/queue/`.
- Each task runs in an isolated `claude -p` subprocess (clean context per task).
- Effort: M.
- Full design: `docs/research/queue-design.md`.

**Layer C — Learning and self-recovery (extensions to history & analytics).** 🔒 on hold (2026-04-17).
Maps to: long-term knowledge, repository awareness deltas, CI feedback loop, budget guardrails, runtime estimator enforcement.
Why fits here: claude-forge already collects most of the data — `history_*`, `profile_get`, `analytics_*`, `phase-log`. What is missing is *closing the loop* so the data influences the running pipeline:

- 🔒 **CI feedback (BACKLOG F19)** — on hold. Post-PR CI watching is less valuable than strengthening pre-PR local verification (lint, test, build, typecheck via `profile_get` commands in `final-verification`). Revisit only after local verification is robust.
- 🔒 **Budget enforcement** — on hold. `analytics_estimate` relies on historical P50/P90, but cold-start (no data) and effort-only granularity (ignores task complexity) make the threshold unreliable. Needs a fallback constant design and richer prediction inputs before implementation.
- 🔒 **Org knowledge (`knowledge_search`)** — on hold. Largest unknown (embedding store choice). Defer until other layers produce enough data to know which knowledge sources are actually missing.
- 🔒 **Profile invalidation** — on hold. Lowest risk item but deferred along with the rest of Layer C.

These are all in-scope for the existing Go MCP server when unblocked.

### Implementation status snapshot

A glanceable view of remaining work. Effort is **post-Layer-B-MVP estimate**: the existing infrastructure (HTTP listener, StateManager guards, history index, etc.) absorbs much of the up-front cost.

| Layer | Item | Status | Effort | Blocks / depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B | Dashboard MVP (timeline, SSE) | ✅ done | — | — |
| B | Intervention API + Approve / Abandon UI | ✅ done | — | — |
| B | `pipeline_fork` MCP tool | ⬜ todo | M | StateManager snapshot helper |
| B | Stop-without-abandon | ⬜ todo | S | Add `StatusPaused` + matching guards |
| B | LAN-watch mode (auth) | 🔒 on hold | M | Multi-user demand unconfirmed |
| C | F19 — CI feedback loop | 🔒 on hold | L | Pre-PR local verification preferred |
| C | Budget enforcement | 🔒 on hold | M | Cold-start + granularity issues |
| C | `knowledge_search` MCP tool | 🔒 on hold | L | Embedding store decision |
| C | Profile invalidation on lockfile drift | 🔒 on hold | S | Layer C deferred as a whole |
| D | `forge-queue` (autonomous task queue) | ⬜ todo | M | 5 MCP tools + 2 skills + Go package |
| A | Cloud sandbox / runner / secrets / scheduler | 🚫 separate product | XL | Whole new repo |

### Recommended sequence (updated 2026-04-17)

Layer B Phase 1 (dashboard + intervention) is shipped on `feature/sse-dashboard-mvp`. Layer C is **on hold** pending foundational improvements (local verification, prediction accuracy). The next steps focus on Layer B:

1. **Layer D / `forge-queue`** (S–M). Highest immediate ROI — enables autonomous batch execution of stocked tasks with zero changes to forge internals. New skill only.
2. **Layer B / `pipeline_fork`** (M). Pairs naturally with the intervention UI — a "fork" button next to Approve / Abandon completes the intervention triad.
3. **Layer B / Stop-without-abandon** (S). One-line addition to the existing intervention API; differentiates "I want to look at this" from "kill it."
4. **Layer B / LAN-watch mode** (M). On hold — revisit when multi-user demand is confirmed.
5. **Layer A** stays out of scope unless a multi-developer offering becomes a strategic goal — that's a separate product decision, not a BACKLOG item.
6. **Layer C** — revisit when: (a) pre-PR local verification (`final-verification` using `profile_get` commands) is robust, (b) `analytics_estimate` has enough historical data and richer inputs (task complexity, language, file count) for reliable predictions.

### What "Devin-class" explicitly does *not* require

For honesty: claude-forge already matches Devin in several places that look like gaps but are not.

- **Multi-phase orchestration with isolated subagents** — already core, in fact stronger than Devin's flat planner.
- **State persistence across restarts** — `state.json` + the 26 state-management commands cover this; Devin's session resume is no more sophisticated.
- **AI review loops (design-reviewer / impl-reviewer / comprehensive-reviewer)** — claude-forge's APPROVE/REVISE cycle has no documented equivalent inside Devin.
- **Effort-aware flow templates** — the `light` / `standard` / `full` template selection is more transparent than Devin's opaque scoping.

The deficit is therefore not in *what the agent can decide* but in *where and when it can run, and how a human watches it*. Layer A and Layer B together close that perception gap; Layer C closes the substantive quality gap once both are in place.

## Recently Resolved (2026-04-17)

Five issues identified during a real-world `/forge` pipeline run on `dealon-app` (DEA-13: Proto Enum sync improvement). All fixed in a single batch:

| # | Issue | Fix location | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Design revision loop stuck | `verdict_parser.go` determineTransition | REVISE verdict spawned architect but stale `review-design.md` caused infinite loop. Fix: detect post-revision stale review via mtime comparison and delete before re-dispatching reviewer. |
| 2 | Checkpoint revise didn't clean review files | `pipeline_next_action.go` P8 block | User choosing "revise" at checkpoint-a rewound to phase-3 but left stale `review-design.md`, preventing re-review. Fix: delete review files on checkpoint rewind. |
| 3 | Common Review Findings showed stale entries | `pipeline_next_action.go` enrichPrompt | Architect saw "seen N times" for already-resolved CRITICALs. Fix: filter patterns matching current review-design.md findings before injecting into prompt. |
| 4 | Architect didn't verify code assumptions | `agents/architect.md` | Architect wrote design details about APIs/types without reading actual source code, causing repeated CRITICAL findings. Fix: added "Verify Before You Write" section with explicit instructions. |
| 5 | Pipeline state opaque during debugging | `pipeline_next_action.go` response struct | `pipeline_next_action` response didn't include current phase/status, making it hard to diagnose state issues. Fix: added `current_phase` and `current_phase_status` fields to response. |
