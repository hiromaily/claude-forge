## Overview

| Dimension | SDD / Single-conversation | claude-forge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Context management** | One growing conversation; quality degrades as context fills | Each phase runs in an isolated subagent with a clean context window |
| **State persistence** | Lost on session restart or context compaction | Disk-based `state.json` — resume anytime, survives compaction |
| **Constraint enforcement** | Prompt instructions only (probabilistic) | Two-layer: prompt instructions + deterministic hook scripts |
| **Adaptability** | One-size-fits-all workflow | 3 effort levels (S/M/L) → 3 flow templates (light/standard/full) |
| **Quality gates** | Manual review at the end | Built-in AI review loops (APPROVE/REVISE) + human checkpoints |
| **Concurrency** | Sequential only | Parallel task implementation with atomic locking |
| **Observability** | None | Per-phase token count, duration, and model tracking |
| **Reproducibility** | Depends on conversation history | All artifacts written to `.specs/` — fully auditable |
| **Integration** | Standalone | GitHub Issues, Jira, automatic PR creation, issue commenting |
| **Testing** | Framework itself is untested | Comprehensive automated test suite — run `bash scripts/test-hooks.sh` for count |
